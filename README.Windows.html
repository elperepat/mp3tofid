<h2>mp3tofid for Windows README</h2>
This file contains some extra information needed to run mp3tofid
on Windows. Read the main <a href="README.html">README.html</a>
as well.
<p>
mp3tofid was written for Unix API's and thus does not port
directly to Windows. Instead it is now ported to run inside
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.
Cygwin is two things: a single dll that emulates a Unix environment
on a Windows machine, and a complete set of tools, applications and
compilers, very similar to what a Unix user would expect on a Unix
box.
mp3tofid needs this dll, and you will the cygwin tools as well, as
rsync is one of them. Download at least the base tools, rsync and
cygrunsrv, which allows rsync to run as an NT service.
<p>
I have only tested this software on my XP box. It will very likely
run on 2000 and NT as well, but on 95/98/ME you will at least have
the problem of not being able to run rsync as a service.
<p>
There's no support for tracking Windows shortcuts inside the MP3
tree like there is for tracking symlinks on Unix. Hopefully, I
will add this in a future release once I have figured out how
to read shortcuts using the cygwin API.
<p>
Here's how I use mp3tofid for cygwin and rsync:<br>
My MP3's live in E:\mp3.<br>
My FID tree is in E:\empegfids.<br>
I have copied mp3tofid.exe to /usr/local/bin
(typically "C:\Program Files\cygwin\usr\local\bin")<br>
I convert my MP3 tree using
<pre>
mp3tofid -Ii /cygdrive/e/mp3 /cygdrive/e/empegfids
</pre>
The target directory must exist.
<p>
I use my XP box as an rsync server, and my empeg as an rsync
client. Here's how I set up my /etc/rsyncd.conf file:
<pre>
[empegfids]
path = /cygdrive/e/empegfids
read only = yes
hosts allow = myempeg.mydomain.com
use chroot = no
</pre>
The command to use on the player is the same as when using a Unix
rsync server. See the main <a href="README.html">README.html</a>.
<p>
Included in this distribution, you'll find "instsrv.sh", a script
that will install rsync as an NT service.
<h3>Editors</h3>
Don't use notepad or wordpad to edit Unix scripts and configuration
files. notepad does not handle Unix newline termination at all, and
wordpad will screw it up when you change something. You will need an
editor that detects and preserves Unix/Windows/Mac line terminations.
<p>
Personally, I use <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>, which comes
with cygwin (or as a native GUI app) but vim is not for everyone,
as it is very unintuitive for Windows users. Try something like
<a href="http://www.sourceedit.com/">SourceEdit</a> which is completely
free or one of the numerous shareware tools in this genre.
